# Dice Game Pig:

Dice Game is a python terminal game, which runs in the code institute mock terminal on Heroku.
The rules of this game:

## How to play

You will need a one dice to play.
The game is a very simple dice game in which two players or more race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). You can eaither paly against the CPU or other users, one or multiple users. At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

•	roll  == “r” - If the player rolls a:

o	1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.

o	2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.

•	roll == “h” - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.

You are playing against the computer or other users, two or more players can join the game.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku

 ### •Steps for deployment:
 
 - Fork or clone this repository
 - Create a new Heroku app
 - Set the build backs to Python or NodeJS in that order
 - Link the Heroku app to the repository 
 - Click on deploy
