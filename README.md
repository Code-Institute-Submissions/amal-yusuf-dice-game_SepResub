# Dice Game Pig:

Dice Game is a python terminal game, which runs in the code institute mock terminal on Heroku.
The rules of this game:

## How to play

You will need a one dice to play.
The game is a very simple dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

•	roll  == “y” - If the player rolls a:

o	1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.

o	2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.

•	roll == “n” - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.

You are playing against the computer.
